Well, I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't want to hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more, no more

I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more

All I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

Hey, livin' with you
Is all I wanted before
I've changed, you didn't
Don't wanna see you no more

And all I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Oh, stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

Well, we were walkin' before we could crawl
And you were lovin' just emotion just all
It's just emotion wasn't music at all
Now I can't stop the music
Now I don't wanna hear it no more
No more, no more, no no more

Stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

Well, I can't stop the music
(Stop this game)
I could stop it before
(It's gonna really end)
Now I don't wanna hear it
(Stop this game)
Don't wanna hear it no more
(It's such a touchy, touchy thing)

Well, I can't stop the music
(Stop this game)
I could stop it before
(It's gonna really end)
Now I don't wanna hear it
(Stop this game)
Don't wanna hear it no more
(It's such a touchy, touchy thing, touchy, touchy thing)

Well, I can't stop the music
(Stop this game)
I could stop it before
(It's gonna really end, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Now I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more
