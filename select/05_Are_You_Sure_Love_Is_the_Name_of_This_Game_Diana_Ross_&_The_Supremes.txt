(One, two, one, two)

Now I'll admit that you've been
Playin' with my heart (Playin', playin')
Just like it was a toy (Playin', playin')
And I've been playing along
And letting you treat me wrong (Playin', playin')
Because it seems to give you joy

Are you sure love is the name of this game?
Are you sure love is the name of this game?

For days on end you just stay away
Waitin' for my heart to weaken
It's like we're playing hide and seek
And I'm the one who's always seeking

Are you sure love is the name of this game?
I wanna know
Are you sure L-O-V-E love is the name of this game?

Well if everything's right (It's alright)
And uptight
How come the heartaches keep repeating?
With every beat my heart is beating
Now can it be that you've been cheating?
Cheating on me

(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)

Now how come you keep on
Telling me lies?
Filling my life with sorrow
Don't know what to expect
From your affection
It's here today and gone tomorrow

Are you sure love, love, love is the name of this game?
I wanna know
Are you sure L-O-V-E love is the name of this game?
Oh
Are you sure love is the name of this game?
Are you sure love, love, love, love, love is the name of this game?
